## üöÄ Why this project exists

I believe tracking your work is an important way of measuring productivity
and is a habit that is very helpful to develop. But the thing about habits
is - if they aren‚Äôt easy and accessible, you will eventually stop doing
them - just like going to a gym that is 40 minutes away :) I tried
different methods to log my work and failed. Google Docs, iCloud
Notes, Notepad++, Sticky Notes, etc. I really wanted a way of tracking
with very little effort so I could make this a habit.
It's pretty obvious that we all spend most of our day on the terminal.
Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if I wrote a feature, committed it and then logged
what I did right then and there without a second thought?
What if I could also search this based on date so I could look at,
for example, how productive I was in the past week?

`workedon` is another attempt of mine to make work logging a habit and
improve my productivity.

## üß† How this project works

This tool is useful in two ways - for logging work and fetching logged work.
The implementation is very simple. Work is logged in the form of
`workedon <text> @ <date>`or just `workedon <text>`
(which uses the current date/time). There is a custom parser that reads the
content, splits it at the `@` to a work and a date component and then uses
the awesome `dateparser` library to parse human-readable dates into datetime
objects. This is then saved in a SQLite database
([File location varies](https://github.com/platformdirs/platformdirs) based
on OS). Logged work can be fetched using multiple options that accept similar
human-readable date/times. The same parser is used again to parse into datetime
objects which are used to query the database. The output uses the current
shell's pager to display a paged list similar to `git log`
(your output may slightly vary based on your shell).

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- Log work from your shell in plain text with human-readable dates/times.
  - The date/time is optional. The default is the current date/time.
  - The `@` character is used to separate the text from the
  date/time.
- Fetch logged work with human-readable dates/times.
- Familiar Git-like interface.
- Filter, sort, delete, format and display logged work on your shell.
- Set date/time format of the output through settings.

## üîß Settings

Whenever `workedon` is run for the first time, a settings file named
`wonfile.py` is generated at the user's configuration directory, which
varies based on OS. To find out, run:

``` {.bash}
workedon --print-settings-path
```

Settings are strings used to configure the behavior of `workedon`.
The currently available settings are:

- `DATE_FORMAT` : Sets the date format of the output.
  - Must be a valid Python [strftime](https://strftime.org/) string.
  - Option: `--date-format <value>`
  - Environment variable: `WORKEDON_DATE_FORMAT`
- `TIME_FORMAT` : Sets the time format of the output.
  - Must be a valid Python [strftime](https://strftime.org/) string.
  - Option: `--time-format <value>`
  - Environment variable: `WORKEDON_TIME_FORMAT`
- `DATETIME_FORMAT` : Sets the date and time format of the output.
  - Must be a valid Python [strftime](https://strftime.org/) string.
  - Setting this overrides `DATE_FORMAT` and `TIME_FORMAT`.
  - Option: `--datetime-format <value>`
  - Environment variable: `WORKEDON_DATETIME_FORMAT`
- `TIME_ZONE` : Sets the time zone of the output.
  - Must be a valid
    [timezone string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
  - Default is the auto-detected timezone using the
    [tzlocal](https://github.com/regebro/tzlocal) library.
  - Option: `--time-zone <value>`
  - Environment variable: `WORKEDON_TIME_ZONE`

Order of priority is Option > Environment variable > Setting.

To find your current settings, run:

``` {.bash}
workedon --print-settings
```

## üßæ Changelog

See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/viseshrp/workedon/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Your input is limited by your shell. Certain characters like the single
  quote `'` behave differently. Put your content within double quotes
  to get around special characters.

  For example:

  ``` {.bash}
  workedon "repairing my wife's phone"
  ```

- The [date parser](https://github.com/scrapinghub/dateparser) which is
  used may misinterpret some irregular phrases of date/time, but mostly
  does great.

- There are some reserved keywords that are used as subcommands and
  cannot be used as the first word of your log's content:
  - `workedon`
  - `what`

  You can use double quotes here as well to get around this.

  For example, this will not work:

  ``` {.bash}
  workedon what my wife asked me to do @ 3pm 3 days ago
  ```

  This is fine:

  ``` {.bash}
  workedon "what my wife asked me to do" @ 3pm 3 days ago
  ```
