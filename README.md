Work logging from the comfort of your shell.

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/viseshrp/workedon/develop/demo.gif)

Installation
------------

``` {.bash}
pip install workedon
```

Requirements
------------

- Python 3.7+

Features
--------

- Log work from your shell in plain text with human-readable dates/times.
  - The date/time is optional. The default is the current date/time.
  - The `@` character is used to separate the text from the
  date/time.
- Fetch logged work with human-readable dates/times.
- Familiar Git-like interface.
- Filter, sort, delete, format and display logged work on your shell.

How it works
------------

This tool is useful in two ways - for logging work and fetching logged work.
The implementation is very simple. Work is logged in the form of
`workedon <text> @ <date>`or just `workedon <text>`
(which uses the current date/time). There is a custom parser that reads the
content, splits it at the `@` to a work and a date component and then uses
the awesome `dateparser` library to parse human-readable dates into datetime
objects. This is then saved in a SQLite database
([File location varies](https://github.com/platformdirs/platformdirs) based
on OS). Logged work can be fetched using multiple options that accept similar
human-readable date/times and uses the same parser to parse and query the
database with datetime objects. The output uses the current shell's pager to
display a paged list similar to `git log`
(your output may vary based on your shell).

Limitations
-----------

- Your input is limited by your shell. Certain characters like the single
    quote `'` behave differently. Put your content within double quotes
    to get around special characters.

  For example:

  ``` {.bash}
  workedon "repairing my wife's phone"
  ```

- There are also some reserved keywords that cannot be used as the first word
    of your log's content:
  - `workedon`
  - `what`
  - `db`

  For example, this is fine:

  ``` {.bash}
  workedon my workedon tool
  ```

  This is not:

  ``` {.bash}
  workedon workedon
  ```

Usage
-----

<!-- [[[cog
import cog
from workedon import cli
from click.testing import CliRunner
runner = CliRunner()
result = runner.invoke(cli.main, ["--help"])
out = result.output.replace("Usage: main", "Usage: workedon")
result = runner.invoke(cli.what, ["--help"])
what_out = result.output
cog.out(
    "``` {{.bash}}\n"
    "$ workedon --help\n"
    "{}\n"
    "$ workedon what --help\n"
    "{}\n"
    "```".format(out, what_out)
)
]]] -->
``` {.bash}
$ workedon --help
Usage: workedon [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...
